Daniel Hartman and Joseph Castaner
Spring 2021 Final Project

How to Run:
1) Open the Unity Project.
2) Go to File, in the top left of the editor. Select Build and Run.
3) Inside the Scenes in Build panel, make sure only Scenes/Server is checked. Hit build and run, and select a location
to place the build (we recommend making a dedicated folder on your desktop).
4) Once that is running, alt-tab back to the editor and hit File and build and run again. This time, uncheck Scenes/Server
and check Scenes/SampleScene. Hit build and run, and select a different location for the client build.
5) Now that the server is running and your client is open, click Activate Server in the client view and click Connect.
6) Run a second instance of the client build, and hit connect. You are now playing in a two player match!

Hit the puck into the opponent's goal to score! 10 Points results in a win!
